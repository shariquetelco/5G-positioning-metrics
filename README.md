# 5G Positioning Raw Measurement Dataset
This repository provides raw datasets of 5G positioning measurements generated using a realistic simulation environment with a MATLAB-based ray tracing tool. The data has been analyzed as part of a research paper submitted to MedComNet 2024, taking place in June 2024 in Nice, France.


Each row of the datasets is composed of the following:
- Base Station (BS) coordinates (x, y, z)
- User Equipment (UE) coordinates (x, y, z)
- Raw measurements (TDOA/AOA/TOA)
- Timestamp of measurement acquisition (1-100)

For each UE position, 100 Monte-Carlo simulations are performed. The timestamp indicates in which Monte-Carlo simulation the measurement is acquired.
The first BS for each timestamp is the reference BS used to compute the TDOA; therefore, no TDOA measurement is shown for that BS.

## ðŸ“¡ Overview

This repository provides a dataset of **5G positioning raw measurements**, simulated in a realistic radio environment using a MATLAB-based ray tracing tool. The data supports high-precision localization studies and reflects practical propagation behavior in 5G networks.

These measurements were analyzed in a paper submitted to **MedComNet 2024**, taking place in **June 2024 in Nice, France**.
